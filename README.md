This is a simple expense tracker project made by me to practice flask api handling and ORM using SQLAlchemy
It uses JS,HTML,Python(flask) and creates a simple UI with basic CRUD applications

Use db.create_all() and db.migrate to create same tables using any query language u want (change the address in sqlalchemy tag)
run the requirements.txt to install dependencies
